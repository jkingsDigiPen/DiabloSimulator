# DiabloSimulator
A text-based WPF program with lots of RNG that simulates the "kill monsters, get loot" core loop of Diablo.

## Visual Mock-Up
Here's a rough sketch of what the game will look like.

## Class Diagram
The elements and interactions of the game (i.e., the model, separate from the view) will be something like this. This is already somewhat divorced from the model currently used in the game, but should give you a rough idea of the scope and number of moving parts.
